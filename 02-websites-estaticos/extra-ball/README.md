## Additional learning resources

* The [Transfer Family](https://aws.amazon.com/aws-transfer-family/) is a practical way to add
sFTP, FTPs and FTP protocol to S3 (among other services, like [EFS](https://aws.amazon.com/efs/?nc1=h_ls)).
You may find the price a little too high, but it makes more sense to treat it as a punishment for using
such a legacy protocol ;)
* [Cloudberry Explorer](https://www.msp360.com/explorer/windows/) is a popular desktop software
for interacting with S3 (among others). It is very convenient if you are using AWS as a personal
repository of data.
* [Pre-signed URLs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ShareObjectPreSignedURL.html) are
a very simple way to generate *share links* for S3 objects.
* To effectively use S3 as a static host provider you will need to understand [what CORS is](https://github.com/programar-cloud/blog/blob/master/content/post/1130-cors.md) (in Spanish).
* William Thelen has an extremely nice collection of study cards (flashcards). You will find several about
[S3](https://quizlet.com/516736315/aws-amazon-s3-flash-cards/), [Athena](https://quizlet.com/517204816/advanced-amazon-s3-and-athena-flash-cards/) and the [Snowball family](https://quizlet.com/518465877/aws-storage-extras-flash-cards/).
* Sooner or later, you will find yourself in a [data lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_lake) project. [Building and operating a data lake on AWS S3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCNVdK5kPWk) provides a good introduction to the topic.

## Additional labs

* The official [Athena workshop](https://catalog.us-east-1.prod.workshops.aws/workshops/9981f1a1-abdc-49b5-8387-cb01d238bb78/en-US) provide a detailed experience on one of the most powerful services present on AWS. Focus in the *basic* part if
you are in a hurry.
* There is also a short-but-nice [Object Lambda workshop](https://catalog.us-east-1.prod.workshops.aws/workshops/65ae1218-0c6b-444a-88bd-02aad3ac8636/en-US) that shows how to process S3 objects on the flight.
* If you have access to an account with populated buckets, [Getting started with Storage Lens](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/amazon-s3-storage-lens/) explains how to understand the content of those mentioned buckets.
